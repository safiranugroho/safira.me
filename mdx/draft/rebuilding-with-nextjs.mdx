- Next 13.4.5
- next-mdx-remote 4.4.1
  - Using next-mdx-remote/rsc
  - https://github.com/nrwl/nx/issues/17428
- tailwindcss 3.3.2
  - @tailwindcss/typography 0.5.9
  - className: `prose dark:prose-invert`
- Deploy using Vercel
  - No config, even?
- https://randoma11y.com/
  - Color scheme changes per session :)
  - Tailwind requires complete class names: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/content-configuration#dynamic-class-names
  - "...it will only find classes that exist as complete unbroken strings in your source files."
  - If the class names are dynamic, it won't generate the corresponding CSS.
- @headlessui/react ^1.7.15

- I almost don't want to publish my old blog posts, but I probably should keep them?
